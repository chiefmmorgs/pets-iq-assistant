The system combines machine learning, expert knowledge bases, GPT-3.5-turbo, and ROMA reasoning agents to deliver reliable veterinary guidance for pet owners.

## 🌟 What Makes It Special?

- **ROMA Integration**: Real-time connection to https://github.com/sentient-agi/ROMA for advanced veterinary reasoning
- **Multi-Source Assessment**: Combines knowledge base signals, OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, Roma agent analysis, and ML classification
- **Docker Containerization**: Complete containerized setup with ROMA FastAPI service and Node.js API
- **Structured Signal Analysis**: Precise symptom detection with weighted confidence scoring
- **Evidence-Based Triage**: Conservative escalation with red flag detection
- **JSON Schema Enforcement**: Consistent, structured responses with differential diagnoses
- **Professional UI**: Rich assessment displays with signal presence indicators

## 🧠 Intelligence Sources

### 1. **ROMA Reasoning Agent**
- **Integration**: Direct connection to sentient-agi/ROMA repository
- **Veterinary Reasoning**: Advanced AI reasoning for complex symptom analysis
- **Docker Service**: Runs as separate FastAPI container for optimal performance
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and graceful fallback

### 2. **Knowledge Base Engine**
- **Weighted Signals**: 200+ veterinary symptoms with severity weights (1-10)
- **Differential Diagnoses**: Multiple possible conditions with reasoning
- **Red Flag Detection**: Automatic escalation for emergency symptoms
- **Synonym Matching**: "not eating" → "loss of appetite", "low energy" → "lethargy"

### 3. **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo Integration**
- **JSON Schema Enforcement**: Structured responses with validation
- **Empathetic Messaging**: Natural language explanations under 150 characters
- **Conservative Triage**: Safety-first approach to recommendations

### 4. **Machine Learning Classification**

- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted assessment based on signal presence

## 🚦 Advanced Triage System

### 🚨 Emergency (Immediate Care)
- **Red Flags**: Breathing difficulties, seizures, bleeding, choking
- **Action**: Immediate veterinary care - do not delay
- **Confidence**: High-weight emergency signals present

### ⚠️ Urgent (24-48 Hours)  
- **Indicators**: Pain, persistent vomiting, neurological signs
- **Action**: Schedule veterinary visit within 1-2 days
- **Confidence**: Multiple concerning signals detected

### 🏠 Home Care (Monitor)
- **Indicators**: Minor symptoms, single isolated signs
- **Action**: Monitor at home with supportive care
- **Confidence**: Low-weight signals or insufficient evidence

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Container Architecture
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  roma:
    # ROMA FastAPI service on port 8001
    image: pets-iq-roma
    healthcheck: /health endpoint monitoring
    
  api:
    # Node.js Express API on port 8000
    image: pets-iq-api
    depends_on: roma service health
    environment: ROMA_HOST=roma, ROMA_PORT=8001
```

### Quick Docker Setup
```bash
# Build and start services
docker compose up -d --build

# Monitor logs
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f roma

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### ROMA Integration Details
- **Repository**: Cloned from https://github.com/sentient-agi/ROMA at build time
- **Communication**: Internal Docker network (roma:8001)
- **Endpoints**: `/health` for monitoring, `/reason` for analysis
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when ROMA service unavailable
